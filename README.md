# Object-Identification

This is the repo for the Squish Object Identification course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

The files provided are the test suites and the demo apps used with the tests. They provide a reference for the workflows covered in the course section.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Squish for Qt installed from the qt.io website. We Recommend using the Squish IDE in order to follow along with the content in the videos.

> App_object_identification_section3: Qt application used as the AUT for section 3. This a Qt Widgets application with a dialog containing a custom button. Built with Qt 6.5.3 MinGw 64-bit.

> App_object_identification_section6: Qt application used as the AUT for section 6. This is a simple Qt Quick applicaiton with 3 rectangles. Built with Qt 6.5.3 MinGw 64-bit.

> suite_object_identification_section2: Example to demonstrate how create and modify the object map. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

> suite_object_identification_section3: Example to demonstrate how to use the properties and methods of an object reference obtained via the object map. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

> suite_object_identification_section4: Example to demonstrate how to work with dynamic properties used in the names. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

> suite_object_identification_section5: Example to demonstrate how to use a modified descriptor for real name genereation. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

> suite_object_identification_section6: Example to illustrate the concept of occurences in the object map. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.
